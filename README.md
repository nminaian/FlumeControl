# FlumeControl

This repo is for the implementation of a software interface to a variable frequency drive (VFD) motor controller. The software interface will allow for control of the motor from a desktop computer. The main components of the software consist of: the VFD-PC interface, mapping VFD frequencies to fluid velocity achieved by the pump/motor, and a graphical user interface.
